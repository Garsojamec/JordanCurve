# Drafted Notes

The goal of this document is to begin our investigation of understanding wtf the Jordan Curve Theorem ( JCT ) is even talking about!

## First Definitions

To establish context, we will define the following:

* Separation
* Connectedness
* Components
* JCT

### Sets
Sets are things that exist lol.

### Ordered Pair
Ordered pair (a,b) is {a,{a,b}}

### Zahlen
Zahlen is subsequent subsets of null set.
{} equals 0
{{}} 1
{{{}}} -1
{{{{}}}} 2

### Quotients
Quotients are ordered pairs of integers
(Top, Bottom) with equivalence relation making equivalent fractions equal
(2,4) is equal to (-1,-2)

### Reals
A cut r is defined to be the set of all quotients that are less than quotient (r,1).
Let R be the set of all dedekind cuts of quotients.

### Topology
Set of open sets. (do we need open balls?)

### Topological Space
(R,O)
R is underlying set, O is topology

### Cartesian Product
Set of all possible ordered pairs for two different sets.

### Function
Subset of cartesian product such that its a function.

### Continuity
Go backwards through the function and you get an open set.

### Separated
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A $\bold{separation}$ of $X$ is a pair $U,V$ of disjoint nonempty subsets of $X$ whose uninon is $X$.

### Connected
The space $X$ is said to be $\bold{connected}$ if there does not exist a separation of $X$.

### Component
Given $X$, define an equivalence relation on $X$ by setting $x ~ y$ if there is a connected subspace of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$.
The equivalence classes are called the $\bold{components}$ ( or the "connected components") of $X$.

### Open Set
element of the topology
### Closure
### Closed Set
### Simple Closed Curve
### Boundary


### JCT
$\mathbf{X}$

I assume for this theorem u have the one part of the line on the inside of the circle, u take the open ball that the part of the line falls inside of, and then take the union of all open balls inside of the circle, the union of all open balls is the interior aka internal balls. u have the one part of the line on the outside of the circle, u take the open ball that the part of the line falls inside of, and then take the union of all open balls outside of the circle, the union of all open balls is the exterior aka external balls.
