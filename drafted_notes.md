# Drafted Notes

The goal of this document is to begin our investigation of understanding wtf the Jordan Curve Theorem ( JCT ) is even talking about!

## First Definitions

To establish context, we will define the following:

* Separation
* Connectedness
* Components
* JCT

### Q
Q is ordered pairs of integers
(Top, Bottom)
### Real Numbers
I wanna use dedekind cuts.
Let R be the set of all dedekind cuts of Q.
### Topology
Set of open sets. (do we need open balls?)
### Topological Space
(R,O) R is underlying set, O is topology
### Cartesian Product
### Separation & Connectedness
Let $X$ be a topological space.
A $\bold{separation}$ of $X$ is a pair $U,V$ of disjoint nonempty subsets of $X$ whose uninon is $X$.
The space $X$ is said to be $\bold{connected}$ if there does not exist a separation of $X$.

### Componnents
Given $X$, define an equivalence relation on $X$ by setting $x ~ y$ if there is a connected subspace of $X$ containing both $x$ and $y$.
The equivalence classes are called the $\bold{components}$ ( or the "connected components") of $X$.

### JCT
$\mathbf{X}$
